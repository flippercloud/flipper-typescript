## Contributing to the Docs

Whenever you add or change capabilities:

1. Update any impacted guides or references.
2. Record the change in the relevant release notes or changelog entry.
3. Ask a teammate for a documentation review if the updates touch exported APIs.

If you spot something missing or incorrect, open an issue or send a pull request—keeping documentation fresh is a team sport.
